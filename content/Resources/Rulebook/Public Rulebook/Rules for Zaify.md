***YA ALLAH, NEW CHANGES APPLIED ON:
2023-06-20 18:04*** 

- Contract:
    
    I make an Oath that WALLAHI I will follow these rules. 
    
    — Signed Syed Addan
    

[[Rules]] start June 26 0000 HRS
---
---

- 1. ***How [[Rules]] Work:***
    1. You make an oath to ALLAH SWT to follow these rules. A commitment to ALLAH is a very huge covenant and can not possibly be broken. This is because these rules are a Contract for a Big Promise with Our Great Lord ALLAH SWT. A promise to ALLAH can be kept intact at any cost.
    2. This promise does not restrict you in your life, you can pause these rules by asking your mod any time, and if (and only if) contact with your mod is not possible, these rules can be paused by verbally saying “I am pausing my rules” and then noting down the time and date somewhere. [[Rules]] will pause after exactly 36 hours. You can then restart it anytime.
    3. Breaking a rule does not break the promise (of course). Breaking a rule simply causes a penalty. You need to complete the penalty and not let it multiply. Be careful not to let penalties multiply as no matter what happens, you must complete the penalties.
- 2. ***With Reference to Changing, Adding, or Removing a Rule:***
    1. To change/remove rule, ask moderator. Changing takes exactly 3 days except [[Salah]] times which take 3 hours.
    2. Moderator is Syed [[Haseeb]].
- 3. ***[[Rules]] Carved In Stone:***
    1. These rules can never ever be nullified or changed by another rule, or avoided through loopholes. They are supreme and have the highest amount of strictness. 
    2. No rule can be added and no rule can be modified to forgive past penalties, or convert them.
    3. RCIS will have clear wording and meanings will be interpreted based on the real, explicit straightforward meaning. No second or implicit meanings will be derived.
    4. Options can not be added to Penalties. 
    5. Penalties can't be replaced.
    6. Past penalties can not be changed.
    7. If it was perceived that a penalty has been caused and it was caused in reality, we can not cancel the penalty by using the forgetfulness rule. 
    8. If we forget the number of penalties, this can not be an excuse to cancel them, we will use an upwards estimation to count the penalties.
    9. All penalties and rules end after death.
    10. Upon a very serious accident that has caused a major injury that will cause us to not complete a specific type of penalty, all those penalties will be paused or forgiven, based on the seriousness of the accident. 
    11. Upon a major accident wherein the ability to note down or track time is hindered, timers will be paused until we recover from the accident.
    12. The only things that can be changed about 1 P3 are as follows: the amount of cash penalty owed can be increased. This applies to past and upcoming penalties.
    - 14. ***Day Streaks [[Rules]]:***
        1. These are valid till Nikah. 
        2. These can never be paused.
        3. No content is to be watched, looked at (except for first look which can't exceed 2 seconds), or listened to that is considered immodest in Islam.
        4. Looking at a picture/video/photograph of a non mahram or listening to their voice or looking at an intimate conversation for lustful desire is to be considered an immodest act in Islam.
        5. We can't touch a non mahram for desire.
        6. We can't meet a non mahram in an isolation where we would be able to sin.
        7. Typing, writing or saying words to incite sexual desire in yourself is not allowed, except for forgetfulness.
        8. If the Day Streaks Rule is broken unknowingly and we notice that later on, the moment we notice that, 1 P3 is caused for breaking it once. A modest approximation will have to be made as to how many times it was broken.
        9. In case of breaking any of these rules, 1 P3s will be caused. When this is done after exactly 15 mins of breaking the rule, another penalty is caused.
    1. The only way the timer of any penalty will stop is if and only if we are in a state of unconsciousness due to an accident, disease or sudden stroke, an incident such as being captured, kidnapped, or locked with no way of getting out, or being in a place or situation where you have no money left and there is no possible way to get cash from somewhere.
    2. Amount owed or any other penalty can be lifted in the case of temporary/permanent memory loss, or permanent unconsciousness/coma/death.
    3. If the penalties become uncountable due to forgetfulness, you must still fulfill and complete them by approximating a higher number.
    4. Wherever it says “Can not be misused” in the rules, this means no loopholes can be created for these types of rules, no tricks can be played to save yourself, and permission of Mod/Accountability Partner will be needed after explanation to him for a special case of you skipping or misusing the rule.
    5. The owed amount in P3 can not be sent to a charity fund as Zakaat.
- 3. ***How Penalties Occur:***
    1. 1 P1 = Doing a 40 second  plank or giving Rs 50 to Charity
    2. 1 P2 = Doing a 50-second wall sit or giving Rs 100 to Charity
    3. 1 P3 = Giving 500 Rs to Charity
    4. For those penalties that you fail to offer before 2130 each night, one will be added to each.
    5. For debts, an accountability book has to be created and to be referred.
    6. If the number of penalties reaches more than 49 on any day, one P3 is caused.
    7. For a plank to be valid it needs to be performed with no support of any kind except below the elbows and arms, on a flat surface, and with the body in a straight line.
