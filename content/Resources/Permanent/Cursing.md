“It is one of the greatest sins that a man should curse his parents.” It was asked (by the people), “O Allah’s Messenger (pbuh)! How does a man curse his parents?”  
The Prophet (pbuh) said, “The man abuses the father of another man and the latter abuses the father of the former and abuses his mother.”  
– Saheeh Al Bukhaari Vol 8, Hadith 5973
