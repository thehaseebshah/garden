The Messenger of Allah (pbuh) said:“Judges are of three types, one who will be in Paradise and two who will be in the Fire. As for the one who will be in Paradise, it is a man who knows the truth and Judges accordingly. And a man who knows the truth, but is unjust in his Judgment, he will be in the Fire, and a man who Judges the people when he is Ignorant will be in the Fire.”  
– Sunan Abu Dawood  
– Vol 4, Hadith 3573
