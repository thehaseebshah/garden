“Shall I inform you about the people of Paradise? They comprise every obscure, unimportant humble person, and if he takes an oath by Allah about something, Allah will fulfil his oath (by doing that). Shall I inform you about the people of the (Hell) Fire? They comprise every cruel, violent, proud and conceited person.”  
– Saheeh Al Bukhaari – Vol 8. Hadith 6071
