Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) said, "Islam is built upon five pillars: testifying that there is no true god except Allah and that Muhammad (peace be upon him) is the messenger of Allah, performing the prayers, paying the zakat, Haj (the pilgrimage to Makkah), and fasting during the month of Ramadan" (Sahih al-Jami # 2837).
