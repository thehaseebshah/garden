# Our Final Note Taking System and Consolidated Research 
First we see [[Where to Take Notes]]
Now let's see [[Note Tags and Folders]]
And [[Types of Notes and their Benefits in Life]]
There are [[Methods of Note Taking]]

%% # Old  Research

- Having knowledge of tools is actually a waste of time if its too much knowledge. Its a burden and a waste of energy. Dont create content on tools in the future. Just have timeless rules and philosophies that must be followed and recommend tools to others and have very short descriptions to share with them on how to use them. Have three kinds of recommendations — one for very basic minimal users, next for normal users and next for advanced power hungry ones. But you need to have a way to be able to shift from tier 1 to 3 on your own tools so as to make it easier to explain to others.
- Use BOTH Notion and Obsidian — Obsidian for PKM and Notion for Collaboration
- **Simple is ALWAYS Better**
- Visual Notes in Journal
- Manual Filing system in Journal for Printed Pages
- Obsidian can be a shiny new thing but the daily usage backlinking can be accomplished in Notion as well bro. Refrain from the shiny object syndrome.
- Matt Daavella was a decade behind in technology — he uses Apple Notes and a simple todo list app. He took 10 minutes to research a reaf later app instead of weeks like me. He did not shift to the trendiest note taking apps.
- Organzing by project lets you get to action items when you sit to solve a project… fast meal pans
- Areas are personality slices or skills you arr tryimg to.improve on… sometimes projects can become areas…. slow meal cookers
- Resources can kickstart future projects
- Your second brain is not for hoarding ideas but to put them into practice
- Domt procrastimate on the systems and tools and start working
- Dont switch apps — do a 90 day trial
- [[Rules]] over Tools — dont stress over
- Day tracking
- Capture only what makes your heart beat faster
- You can provide a unique spin on the content you create and people might end up loving it. Dont think you are duplicating.
- The number 4 is a magic number. Research indicates that ref: Productivity Guru. So each of PARA should be max 4 levels deep.
- Everything is knowledge. Add everything to your system. It will grow into what it needs to grow into.
- If you have to use one between Notion and Obsidian, choose Notion
- PARA in Obsidian
    - Areas will go into your life management app
    - Projects can be tagged in obsidian — this will create a 3 way link between task/projecr manager, life manager and note taking app
    - Obsidian can include a type of note called to_publish
    - You can have topic_tag in Obsidian for resource tags
- Journalling can be in video form
-

    Some reference [[notes]], like books, can become longer
    
    When you use “ghost [[notes]]” or empty [[notes]] as tags, they start to become bigger in the graph and then you can call them MOCs and fill out details in them — but they stay in Atomic Notes folder. The goal is to use just one folder for all [[notes]] and use tags to organize them. Your system will evolve — for example if you are a mathematician, you may end up using a tag — but dont over complicate things from the beginning
    
    Fleeting [[notes]] can be audio [[notes]]
    
    While reading a book you should be immersed in it so dont right ideas in your words. Just highlight or rephrase slightly on the sides of pages or on sticky [[notes]]. Or add your little thoughts pn sticky [[notes]] or sides of pages, or a seperate page.
    
    Once youre done with a chapter of a book, make permanent [[notes]] and literature [[notes]] using the highlights and [[notes]]. Ask yourself if it is an important thing to take a permanent note about.
    
    Literature Notes are like to_summarize [[notes]] that you already create. They are longer than fleeting [[notes]].
    
    The bibliovraphy note that the PhD student created in her video is actually a map of content note. Reference [[notes]] are different I think. Also Hub [[notes]] Darin Suthapong explained are also examples of MOCs. They are entry points to your knowledge management system
    
    Fleeting [[notes]] can be daily [[notes]] that you archive or delete at the end of the day
    
    Darin says you can start with a Daily Note, enter your ideas there, and add Literature and Permanent Notes right there. Then move them into their seperate folders. He even keeps a “Fleetings Notes” folder which I do not like. They need to be archived or deleted. He also has a Hub Notes folder which I do not like. Obsidian is not about folders and structure but you need to allow the structure to emerge itself. We are disregarding Darin’s video therefore. So we found two good obsidian videos overall on the internet. One was the Ultimate Guide and the other was a Minimalist System.
    
    Structure is Expensive

    Your Notion Life Organization System should at least have links to your different resources like Habit Trackers, CRMs, Contacts etc.
    
    You do not need a resources folder in your Todolist and also not in your [[notes]] because of search functionality??
    
    prevent the two primary sins of organizational overengineering: too many categories, and too many levels of hierarchy.
    
    ![Untitled](Resources/System/Attachments/Ultimate%20Guide%20to%20Note%20Taking%20and%20PKM%20cef4d1393aa54970a7ffc10f42253609/Untitled%202.png)
    
    The key here is to keep in mind that areas are Areas of *Responsibility*. There is a very clear line between things that you are *responsible* for, and those that you’re merely *interested* in.
    
    Areas of Responsibility are the **roles you take on in life** and the **hats you wear** (Spouse, Mother/Father, Team Leader, Soccer Coach), the **ongoing standards where the buck stops with you** (Product Development, Company Newsletter, Legal), and **things that take a certain amount of constant attention** (Exercise, Finances, Apartment, Pets).
    
    Resources are **interests** (web design, crowdfunding, woodworking, frisbee golf, bio-hacking), **themes** (psychology, politics, leadership, integrity), and **assets** (stock photos, typography links, marketing swipe file, product testimonials, code snippets). I even use lower-case titles with resource notebooks, to remind myself that they are just interests, and capital letters for areas of responsibility.

Important: Start Small and very minimal and also make the system EXTREMELY LOW M[[AI]]NTENANCE because you do not want yourself to be burdened by it. Everything should be efficient

## September 2023
> It may be difficult to believe that a complex, modern human life like yours can be reduced to just four categories. It may feel like you have far more to deal with than can fit into such a simple system.
> 
> But that is exactly the point: if your organizational system is as complex as your life, then the demands of maintaining it will end up robbing you of the time and energy you need to live that life.
> 
> The system you use to organize information has to be so simple that it frees up your attention, instead of taking more of it. Your system has to give you time, not take time.
> 
> ![[Pasted image 20230913121507.png]]
> 
> The exact same project list is replicated across every program
> 
> Here’s why this is important: you will always need to use multiple programs to complete projects. You may use a centralized platform like Basecamp, Asana, Jira, or Zoho, but technology is advancing too quickly on too many fronts for any one company to do every single function best.
> 
> Instead of fighting the tide and looking for “one platform to rule them all,” formulate your Project List and then replicate that list across every single tool you use, now and in the future. I recommend doing so down to the exact same spelling, punctuation, and capitalization, so that your transitions between programs are as seamless as possible.
> 
> I’ve noticed that people tend to use different organizational schemes in every program they use. They try to adapt a different scheme to the capabilities of each program, forcing their brains to “load up” and remember a different one every time they switch programs. This creates a friction to learning new tools that might be better suited to specialized tasks, inhibiting innovation.

Everything should be in PARA according to Tiago. Nothing else outside it. The only folder in addition to PARA that you can have is Inbox of course.

Start with something simple and wait till it breaks

When you search the internet for knowledge, the algorithm determines what kind of knowledge you see.

[[Physical Zettlekasten]]


> **When it comes to the [Zettelkasten folder structure](https://mattgiaro.com/folder-structure-Zettelkasten/), don’t create a new folder.**
> 
> I recommend starting with a FLAT structure. A flat structure implies that you start with no folder at all. This is how you truly replicate Niklas Luhmann’s Zettelkasten. Remember that the word “Zettelkasten” is composed of two words: Zettel (notes) and Kasten (box). All notes were contained in one giant box. This box is nothing else than your Obsidian vault.
> 
> You can check out Reddit or the Obsidian Forum to see what others are doing. But beware of frying your brain with overcomplicated productivity wizardry.

**Luhmann’s original Zettelkasten worked because it was easy to maintain.** Not because it was complicated. You should take this holistic approach, too.

Don’t get blinded and bogged down by 1 hour and 46 seconds complicated workflow walkthroughs.

However, to create a great permanent note, **the goal is to rewrite everything in your own words** (also called the Feynman technique.)

Here’s an example:

![How to create a permanent (and litterature) note in Obsidian](https://mattgiaro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/creating-a-permanent-litterature-note-in-obsidian-1024x743.jpg)

Tiago Forte says every app that he uses is at least 10 years old. He doesn't even want to touch or try anything that is less than 5 years old. You can't adopt a new hammer if you are a carpenter.

The more complex an App is, the more you will procrastinate on it

Have a completely flat folder structure

Only use 3 tags at most, or no tags

Only have 4 folders at max: notes, sources, templates, files

Don't use tags 

> The flat system has no hierarchy. Everything is just a note. This is the best system to organize your notes if you want to set up a zettelkasten-style slip box.
> 
> Without folders or categories, you might think that it would be impossible to navigate a system like this. But there are two powerful tools you can use.
> 
> Right now, you’re motivated, interested, and have the time to invest in creating a note-taking system. But there will come a time when you feel tired, lazy, and don’t care about your system, you just need to take a note.
> 
> So, design your system for your worst day. Otherwise, when those days come, your system will fall apart.
> 
> How do you design a system for your worst days? Make it simple.
> 
> - **Add one link in every note you make**

> ## The Three Golden Rules for PKM
> 
> 1. Note-taking must be frictionless
> 2. Finding a note must be quick and easy
> 3. Browsing should be fun
> 
> ### Frictionless note-taking
> We have so much great software available to us now, so why do people still use pen and paper for taking notes?
> 
> Analog note-taking has one major advantage; it’s frictionless. No software is as quick and effortless as scribbling notes down on a scrap of paper.
> 
> Until an app comes along that can create an experience as simple as pen and paper, all you can do is make your experience as painless as possible. 

The benefits of the system don't increase with its complexity, in fact it's the opposite.
- Computers have the tendency to pull you towards shiny colorful lights away from your core values and principles
- Only a select number of notes get turned into permanent notes 
- Have One Topic Tag per Permanent Note, called the Up link, and one Link to another permanent note at least. One up and one across connection. Up and related.
- Don't create Hub or Index notes immediately. Let the structure immerge itself.
- Videos about Obsidian to Recommend:
    Do not procrastinate on Note Taking Tools

- Difference between Literature and References notes
	- Both are the same
- There are Two Folder Structures:
	- [[Obsidian Onboarding]] for beginners
	- [[My PKM Folders]] for me, an advanced user.
- Use no tags
- Temporary: [[What to do with DO NOT MOVE NOTES HERE Folder]]
- Note taking should be frictionless
- Make it easy and simple: use PARA
- Tiago Forte says every app that he uses is at least 10 years old. He doesn't even want to touch or try anything that is less than 5 years old. You can't adopt a new hammer if you are a carpenter.
- Don’t get blinded and bogged down by 1 hour and 46 seconds complicated workflow walkthroughs.
- Having knowledge of tools is actually a waste of time if its too much knowledge. Its a burden and a waste of energy. Dont create content on tools in the future.
