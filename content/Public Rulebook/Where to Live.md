# Okay so here’s the decision:

We went through the best countries list and figured out that the only countries worth migrating to were Egypt and Pakistan. Period. (Update Sep 2023: Malaysia is also good. See [[Best Countries List]])

Well we are already in Pakistan and the other reasons to stay in your own home country rule out Egypt. 

And then we watched that song about people living outside. So it’s final guys!!! We are living in Islamabad!!! ALHAMDOLILLAH!!!

Now we need to decide where to live in Islamabad. Well choose G11 or I10 for now.

Afterwards for living choose either of Park View City, Gulberg Greens or B17.

Next create a Muslim Village in Islamabad area.

After the great war (if it happens in your time) shift to Madinnah permanently.

Update Sep 2023: We have chosen Bara Kahu as the permanent Islamabad residence (And consequently Muslim Village)

### Other Muslim Villages (For me)
1. Islamabad (Bara Kahu)
2. Mianwali (Main)
3. Kohat (Garbogha)
4. Madinah
---

So now for the job, well choose a remote job in either of:

- UAE
- Saudi Arabia
- Qatar
- The US
- Pakistan
---

For marriage,

I think it’s better to choose someone from Mianwali but we can discuss about this later. It is not necessary to be of Mianwali and this criteria can be compromised and is here for focussing our search only.

Now for arranging our current home, we can use this strategy;

Guest Room — Arab Culture Theme

Dining Room — Turkish Village Sufi Theme

Upper Bedroom — No Theme

Our Brother Bedroom — Pakistani Village Theme

Our Studio, Workroom, Training Room and Game-room— Natural, [[Islamic]] and Minimal Theme

Store Room — No Theme

Fatima’s Room — Fatima chooses herself

Entrance — No Theme

Prayer Hall — No Theme

Living Room — No Theme 
---

Office will be in NSTP first and then in either I10 or G11.

Then it will shift to B17

Then a branch in UAE

Then a branch in Turkey

Then a branch in Malaysia

Then a branch in the US

Then a branch in Qatar

Then a branch in Saudi Arabia

Then a branch in Egypt

Then a branch in the Muslim Village
