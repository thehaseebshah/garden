1. Introduction
    1. RCIS will have clear wording and meanings will be interpreted based on the real, explicit straightforward meaning. No second or implicit meanings will be derived.
    2. These can never ever be nullified or changed by another rule, or avoided through loopholes. They are supreme and have the highest amount of strictness.
2. For Rule Follower
    1. No rule can be added and no rule can be modified to forgive past penalties, or convert them.
    2. Options can not be added to Penalties.
    3. Penalties can't be replaced.
    4. Past penalties can not be changed.
    5. If it was perceived that a penalty has been caused and it was caused in reality, we can not cancel the penalty by using the forgetfulness rule.
    6. If we forget the number of penalties, this can not be an excuse to cancel them, we will use an upwards estimation to count the penalties.
    7. Unforeseen circumstances for all additions of penalties will not stop the addition.
    8. All penalties and rules end after death.
    9. Upon a very serious accident that has caused a major injury that will cause us to not complete a specific type of penalty, all those penalties will be paused or forgiven, based on the seriousness of the accident.
    10. Upon a major accident wherein the ability to note down or track time is hindered, timers will be paused until we recover from the accident.
    11. The only things that can be changed about 1 P4 are as follows: the amount of cash penalty owed can be increased. This applies to past and upcoming penalties.
    12. Immediately within 24 hours of _Stipulated Time_ daily, you need to send the owed amount accumulated from P4s to the charity fund mentioned in the rules and send/show a receipt to the AP. If you fail to send the amount and send/show the receipt within time, you owe the charity more by an amount equal to 1 P4. This addition will keep on happening until owed amount is 0.
    13. The Charity Fund can not be something that has the ability to get you your donated cash back. It has to be one of the major charity organizations in the country, like Al Akhuat, Al Khidmat, Saylani, Dawat e Islami etc.
    14. You can not in any way get the cash that you have donated back from the charity fund.
    15. The only excuse to not add more P4s to the original owed amount is if and only if we are in a state of unconsciousness due to an accident, disease or sudden stroke, an incident such as being captured, kidnapped, or locked with no way of getting out, or being in a place or situation where you have no money left and there is no possible way to get cash from somewhere, or there is no way to communicate to accountability partner.
    16. The only way the timer of any penalty will stop is if and only if we are in a state of unconsciousness due to an accident, disease or sudden stroke, an incident such as being captured, kidnapped, or locked with no way of getting out, or being in a place or situation where you have no money left and there is no possible way to get cash from somewhere.
    17. Any penalty other than P4 can be lifted in the case of temporary/permanent memory loss, or permanent unconsciousness/coma/death. %%The P4s will be accounted for on the day of judgment and ALLAH SW will decide how to account for them.%%
    18. If the penalties become uncountable due to forgetfulness, you must still fulfill and complete them by approximating a higher number.
    19. Wherever it says “Can not be misused” in the rules, this means no loopholes can be created for these types of rules, no tricks can be played to save yourself, and permission of Mod/Accountability Partner will be needed after explanation to him for a special case of you skipping or misusing the rule.
    20. The owed amount can not be sent to a charity fund as Zakaat.
    21. _**Day Streaks Rules:**_
        1. These are valid till Nikah.
        2. These can never be paused.
        3. No content is to be watched, looked at (except for first look which can't exceed 2 seconds), or listened to that is considered immodest in Islam.
        4. Looking at a picture/video/photograph of a non mahram or listening to their voice or looking at an intimate conversation for lustful desire is to be considered an immodest act in Islam.
        5. We can't touch a non mahram for desire.
        6. We can't meet a non mahram in an isolation where we would be able to sin.
        7. Typing, writing or saying words to incite sexual desire in yourself is not allowed, except for forgetfulness.
        8. If the Day Streaks Rule is broken unknowingly and we notice that later on, the moment we notice that, 3 P4s are caused for breaking it once. A modest approximate will have to be made as to how many times it was broken.
        9. In case of breaking any of these rules, 5 P4s will be caused. When this is done after exactly 15 mins of breaking the rule, another penalty is caused.
    22. With Reference to Changing, Adding, or Removing a Rule:
    23. %%Changing the end-time for a Salah takes 3 hours. Change it and then change last changed date in heading.%%
    24. Changing any other rule takes exactly 3 days, so does removing a rule.
    25. No ease can be granted for a rule immediately just because another rule is being made strict, or another strict rule is being added, be it the same rule.
    26. Newly added rules will be in effect immediately or after their start date specified.
    27. Any rule, or edit in rule, that increases strictness, will be added immediately or after the start date specified even if it modifies another rule. If increasing strictness creates an ease in some way whatsoever, that strictness will have to wait 3 days.
    28. No rule can be paused to make it strict.
    29. You must change the last changed date in the heading in order to put the changes into place.
    30. Making changes to Mamoolat Sheet in a way that changes its functioning mechanism or making changes to Mamoolat Rules or any other rule connected to it takes 3 weeks, except the changes allowed in this rule. You can add more sheets for upcoming months, and also increase the cost of rewards, change what we do in Pomodoros, or change Pomo times. Any rule that increases strictness is added immediately however but If increasing strictness creates an ease in some way whatsoever, that strictness will have to wait 3 weeks. When we mention rules connected to Mamoolat rules, we are only talking about a direct connection. Nothing else can be added to the allowed changes connected to Mamoolat Rules except the ones mentioned above.
    31. When vacations are granted automatically due to an issue or unforeseen incident, they end one day after that incident is no longer impeding. You have to imagine the opinion of Abu Bakar Bhai of Al Burhan, when he would say it is non-impeding then it would be non-impeding. They can end even before the specified end date if the incident becomes non-impeding.
    32. In case of a very sudden, unexpected or catastrophic incident, vacations can be granted immediately. In such a case that Salahs cannot be offered, there will be no penalty for Salahs. Penalties won't increase after Stipluated time in this case. Any other rule that is impeded by this unforeseen incident will also be paused. This rule can not be misused. Anything can not be called an unexpected incident to save yourself from rules. If you are in a position to access and make changes to this document, you must specify how many days worth of vacation this is going to be, within 3 days, or 10 P4s are caused. If we have access to reach out our AP, we must ask them to decide weather the sudden, unexpected or catastrophic incident was valid, and we must not try to convince them. If they say it is not valid, the vacation was not actually granted. (To be added in 2 days)
    33. If you are not sure if a penalty has been caused or not, you must check the rules to find out what the case is, if you leave yourself in this state of confusion for more than 24 hours, X P4s is/are caused for each day that passes by after the 24 hour mark, until you finally check to rules to clear your confusion. The number X can be increased here but not decreased. X is currently 1.
    34. (To be added in 4 days) Forgetfulness does not mean forgetfulness to add a specific rule.
3. For Accountability Partner
    1. The accountability partner must make the RF send the owed amount to the charity. It is his responsibility.
    2. The accountability partner can not facilitate the rule follower in any way possible to accommodate for his or her penalties.
    3. The accountability partner can not facilitate a loophole in the rules, meant to breach the purpose the rules were meant to fulfill.
    4. The accountability partner can not facilitate the rule follower in accessing back in any way possible the penalized cash.
