6. Stipulated Time:
    1. 0000 HRS
7. Rule Document Classification:
    1. RCIS — these rules can never ever be nullified or changed by another rule, or avoided through loopholes. They are supreme and have the highest amount of strictness. This is evident by the fact that even spelling mistakes haven't been corrected in these rules.
    2. Current Rules — these are rules that can be changed in the future. All of these have penalties attached to them
    3. Rule Enforcement Systems — these are systems designed to enforce rules onto you
    4. Future Rules — this is a store for rules that we intend to add to Current Rules in the future
    5. Rulings Without Penalties — these are firm intentions (Type II promises) and Oaths (Type IV promises) that do not have penalties attached to them but need to be followed still. All statements are firm intentions, except for the ones that are oaths (mentioned thereby)
    6. Other Discipline Systems — this document enlists other discipline systems outside of the rules mentioned in the Rulebook
    7. Changes to be Made — this document highlights the changes that need to be made in the next iteration of the rules
8. These Rules should be kept safe because they still remain even after the record is lost.
10. How Penalties Occur:
    1. 1 P4 = You owe Rs 500 to Charity Fund
    3. 1 P2 = Doing a 60 second plank. This should be performed on a near-straight surface. There can be no support of any kind. The hips should be lowered to make a straight line with the rest of the body, no part of the body can be raised upwards, but it can be lowered even further to make it harder. The plank should be done exactly as this picture, where elbows are touching the ground:
	    1. ![[Pasted image 20231227115311.png]]
    5. If you realise that a penalty other than P4 was caused 3 days later, it is not caused.  
    6. Penalties doubles after *Stipulated Time* in the sense that 1 P becomes 2 Ps. 
    7. If you remember more than 24 hours later that a penalty other than P4 was not performed according to the rules, it is accepted. Otherwise it is to be repeated. This does not apply if the penalty was not even completed. 
    9. If we have more than 49 penalties overall in a day, 1 P4 is caused. Forgetfulness does not apply here.
2. ***Vacations:***

        4. Nasheed Rules
    4. Vacation rules can not be misused. 
    5. A Health Vacation can be issued which only overrides Health Rules.
