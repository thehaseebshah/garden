	    - Where your future self will want to find it

	- The Only memories you should be noting down
		- Before noting down the memory consider the big picture by seeing to it that the memory you note down read some great results.
		- If it is a Life lesson then surely note it down
		- remember this that you should only note a memory down in text or in picture not in the form of an audio or a video, unless the audio or video is necessary in conditions where you really need to note down a prominent memory.
