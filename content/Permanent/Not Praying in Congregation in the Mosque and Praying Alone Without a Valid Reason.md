“No doubt, I was about to order somebody to pronounce the Iqaamah of the (compulsory congregational) Salaah and then I would go to the houses of those who do not attend the Salaah ! (in the mosque) and burn their houses over them.”  
– Saheeh Al Bukhaari Vol 3, Hadith 2420 “No Salaah (prayer) is harder for the hypocrites than the Fajr and the ‘Ishaa prayers, and if they knew the reward for these Salaah, at their respective times, they would certainly present themselves (in the mosques) even if they had to crawl.” The Prophet (pbuh) added, “I was thinking about ordering the Mu’adh-dhin to pronounce the Iqaamah and a man to lead the Salaah, and then taking a burning torch to burn all those men who had not yet left their houses for the Salaah (in the mosques).”  
– Saheeh Al Bukhaari Vol 1, Hadith 657
