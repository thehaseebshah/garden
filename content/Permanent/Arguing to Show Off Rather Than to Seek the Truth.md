“The head of the matter is Islaam, its pillar is the Salaah, and its peak is Jihaad.’ Then he said, ‘Shall I not inform you about what governs all of that?’ I said, ‘Of course, O Messenger of Allah!’ So he (pbuh) took hold of his tongue and said, ‘Restrain this.’ I said, ‘O Prophet of Allah! Will we be taken to account for what we say?’ He said, ‘May your mother grieve your loss, O Mu’aadh! Are the people tossed into the Fire upon their faces for anything except what their tongues have wrought?””  
– Sunan At Tirmidhi
