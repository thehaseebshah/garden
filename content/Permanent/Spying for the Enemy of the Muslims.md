“Let not the Believers take for-friends or helpers Unbelievers rather than Believers: if any do that, in nothing will there be help from Allah except by way of precaution, that you may guard yourselves from them. But Allah cautions you (to remember) Himself; for the final goal is to Allah.”  
– Al Qur’aan 3:28
