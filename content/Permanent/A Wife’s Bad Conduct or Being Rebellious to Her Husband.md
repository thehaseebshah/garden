“If a husband calls his wife to his bed (i.e. to have sexual relations) and she refuses and causes him to sleep in anger, the angels will curse her till morning.”  
– Saheeh Bukhaari Vol 4. Hadith 3237 “I was shown the Hell-fire and that the majority of its dwellers were women who were ungrateful.” It was asked, “Are they ungrateful to Allah?” He replied, “They are ungrateful to their husbands and are ungrateful for the favours and the good done to them. If you have always been good to one of them for a period of time and then she sees something in you (not of her liking), she will say, ‘I have never seen any good from you.”  
– Saheeh Bukhaari Vol 1, Hadith 29
