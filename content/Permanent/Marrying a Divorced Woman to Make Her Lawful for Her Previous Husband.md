It was narrated that Abdullah (ra) said:“The Messenger of Allah (pbuh) Cursed … Al Muhallila and Al Muhallala Lahu”  
(Al Muhallila is the Man who Marries a Woman in order to Divorce her, so that she can Go Back to her Previous Husband. Al Muhallala Lahu is the Previous Husband for whom this is done)
