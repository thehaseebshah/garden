“The Messenger of Allah (pbuh) turned to u us and said: ‘O Muhaajireen, there are five things with which you will be tested, and I seek refuge with Allah lest you live to see them … (the people) do not cheat in weights and measures except that they will be stricken with famine, severe calamity and oppression at the hands of their rulers.”  
– Sunan Ibn Maajah – Vol 5, Hadith 4019
