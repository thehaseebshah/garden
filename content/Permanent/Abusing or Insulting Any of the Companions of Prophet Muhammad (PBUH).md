“The Messenger of Allah (pbuh) said: ‘Do not revile my companions, for by the One in Whose Hand is my soul, if one of you were to spend the equivalent of Mount Uhud in gold, it would not equal the Mudd (two-thirds of a kilogram) of one of them, or even half of it.”  
– Sunan Abu Dawood Vol 5, Hadith 4658
