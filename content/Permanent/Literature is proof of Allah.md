This lesson I learned right now as I was reading the translation of [[Peer e Kamil SAWW]] and feeling the rush of emotions again. If stories can make you believe in Allah, it is the kind of stories that this story is, not the kind that [[Life of Pi]] is. I can very clearly comprehend that the full meaning of the text was not able to be translated and transferred and transmitted to the English version. The East is rich in what the west was made to abhor centuries ago, and language reflects that cultural inclination grandly.
