- If there are no prominent time constraints, and the restriction is a modest one, prefer to write down any with the right hand index finger and with a capital letter.
- The same goes for an Alif
- Also when using a new pen for the first time prefer writing the FIRST letter as an Alif or An A اِ نْ شَآ ءَ اللّهُ ☺️
- Everything associated with THE BELOVED THE CHOSEN ONE OR THE MASTER SHOULD PREFERABLY EITHER START WITH A CAPITAL LETTER OR BE IN FULL CAPS INSHALLAH
