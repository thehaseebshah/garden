This time to do [[AI]] is a blessing. Do it while you can, or you will get a job and a new specialty will show up. And besides, you ****are**** going to start a full time job as part of your family‚Äôs business anyway. No more 3 pomos boy. Therefore now you can add this as entertainment time lectures too that you can watch in the bathroom, or durimg travels.
