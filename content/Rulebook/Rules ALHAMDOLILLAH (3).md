**BISMILLAH HIRAHMAN NIRAHEEM**
---

**YA RABB, NEW CHANGES APPLIED ON:**

July 10
---

**RULES CARVED IN STONE**:

1. No rule can be added and no rule can be modified to forgive past penalities, or convert them.
2. Optipns can not be added to Penalties. Penalties can't be replaced.
3. 1 L3P can not be changed unless the amount of cash penalty is being increased or a flaw has shown up that is creating a loophole in the Day Streaks Rule. Also, the time for the penalty to double can be reduced or the time when another penalty is introduced as a consequence of breaking the rule again, can be decreased. Options can not be added for 1 L3P. 1 L3P can not be replaced.
4. ***Day Streaks [[Rules]]:***
    1. These are valid till Nikah. These can never be paused.
    2. No content is to be watched, looked at (except for first look which can't exceed 3 seconds), or listened to that is considered immodest in Islam. 
    3. The secret sin can not be performed.
    4. In case of breaking any of these rules, 1 L3P will be caused.  When this is done after exactly 15 mins of breaking the rule, another penalty is caused. This time can only be decreased, not increased.
---

1. ***With Reference to Changing, Adding, or Removing a Rule:***
    1. Changing the time for a [[Salah]] takes 3 hours.
    2. Changing any other rule takes exactly 3 days.
    3. No change can be made that compromises on the effectiveness of the *Day Streak [[Rules]].*
    4. No rule can be removed or altered to increase penalty of same or other rule. 
    5. Newly added rules will be in effect immediately or after their start date specified.
    6. Any rule that increases strickness will be added immediately or after the start date specified even if it modifies another rule. 
    7. In order to implement new changes in rules, we need to change last changed date in the heading.
    8. A rule can not be paused for a few days to increase its penalty.
    9. There are two types of [[Rules]]: Normal [[Rules]] and [[Rules]] Carved in Stone (RCIS). RCIS can never ever nullified or changed by another rule, or avoided through loopholes. They are supreme and have the highest amount of strictnesses. 
2. ***How Penalties Occur:***
    1. 1 Level-3 Penalty (L3P) = Reducing to at least 8 pieces a Rs 3100 note or the equivalent -- 8 pieces for each note (the equivalent should also be real bank [[notes]] equaling or higher than the amount of penalty). The pieces will need to be thrown away and can't be aquired later. The pieces should be almost equal in size and the note(s) should be uniformly reduced. After five hours of occurrence of penalty, penalty increases by 1 L3P.
    1 Level-2 Penalty (L2P) = Doing a 70 second proper straight plank on a hard surface. Penalty Doubles after 0000 HRS, in the sense that 1 L2P becomes 2 L2Ps.
    2. 1 Level-1 Penalty (L1P) = Doing a 50 second proper, straight plank on a hard surface. Penalty doubles after 0000 HRS, same as before. 
    3. All old penalities, L1P and L2P do not add up from now on. Also, Unforseen circumstances for all upcoming additions of new penalties will not stop the addition.
3. ***Food [[Rules]]:***
    1. We can't buy to eat except on Freestyle Days. This will be paused starting 1 second after NEW START.
    2 L2Ps occur when something of Rs 50 or less is bought to eat. Buying for more than 50 increases the number of penalities.
    2. Food can be allowed when we earn it through rewards.
    3. We can't ask anyone to allow us their money for food. We can't even hint them subtly that we are hungry. We can't eat something if it's bought by someone else and even for someone else. If they say themselves, you point out that you're won't. If they insist, tell them again. If they say the third time, you tell them your rules are in place, but don't tell them about the loophole in the rules. If you don't warn them like this, the penality will be caused. If after the 2nd warning the still insist, we can eat. We can't tell someone about the rule loophole unless 
    4. Nothing is an unforeseen circumstance except forgetfulness. Paying for hostel food as rent is not part of the rule nor is paying for food to cook at home just as Baba does. This does not include making anything to drink. Food that is bought to eat at home by others in Mianwali does not come under this rule. 
4. ***[[Salah]]*** ***[[Rules]]:***
    1. The Faraidh of [[Salah]] should be offered before end time completely. Otherwise 1 L2P is incurred.
    2. Buffer minutes are 15 when Whudu can be done in 5 minutes, they are 20 when Wudhu or Ghusl can be done in 10 mins, and they are 20 when Wudhu or Ghusl can be done in 15 mins. Additional 10 mins added if it is planned to offer [[Salah]] with Jamah. If not offered with Jammah after making up mind and adding buffer minutes, then 1 L1P is incurred.
    If one is reminded of [[Salah]] and less than or equal to buffer minutes remain before end time, one should start winding up, and time is to be noted somewhere whenever possible in the following manner: The minute-measurment  of Noted Time needs to be a multiple of 5, and if it's not, we need to round the current time minute-measurment to the nearest 5 and then note it. Not noting time when it's possible causes 1 L2P to be incurred. Now the buffer minutes will be added to the noted time to declare new end time.
    3. If due to forgetfulness [[Salah]] is missed then upon realizing that [[Salah]] is missed, time should be noted and buffer minutes are added to noted time to declare new end time, even if the [[Salah]] is Qadha.
    4. If new end time takes one into the Makrooh [[Salah]] time, then we can relax and wait to be reminded of [[Salah]] again outside of Makrooh time.
    5. A [[Salah]] Alarm is an alarm that was meant to wake one up from [[Salah]].
    6. If one wakes up from sleep and does not heed to and turn off the first [[Salah]] alarm one hears and sit up on the bed immediately within 10 seconds, one L2P is incurred.  Under one minute of sitting on the bed one should also get out of bed -- not doing so causes the same penalty. Not creating an alarm intentionally also incurs same penalty. Sleepiness or unconsciousness is not an excuse, except for utter unciousness. 
    7. Nothing is an unforeseen circumstance except forgetfulness. Only one forgetfulness is allowed.
    8. Penalty Completion Rule to be added soon. 
    9. If a penalty occurs due to not offering [[Salah]] on time, we still need to offer it on the same day or another penalty will be added. If not offered on the next day even, then another penality will be caused. And this process will keep on repeating until it is offered.
    10. End times defined below:
        - Fajr -- 0530
        - Zhuhr -- 1415
        - Asr -- 1800
        - Maghrib -- 2000
        - Isha -- 2145

            - 0930-1030

    4. Within the Pomodoro, either phone should be set to focussed mode, or put away, unless it constitutes work.

    7. Things not included in Pomodoro are: 
        - Watching Tech Videos
        - Watching [[Islamic]] or Personal Growth Lectures
    8. If a distraction interrupts a Pomodoro and can not be excused, then the time remaining should be covered afterwards if it is expected that the distraction will take more than 1 minute and the timer should be stopped. If it is expected to take less than one minute, the timer will not be stopped. If the timer was stopped in the last Pomodoro, then the rest time of the next Pomodoro is not necessary.

    10. We can complete voluntary Pomodoros anytime at will.

    5. If a conversation with someone from the opposite gender has started, we should proceed towards an end as soon as possible. Also, [[Dawah]] can be an opportunity if the conversation was started from their end. We should not start a conversation unless necessary even for general [[Dawah]]. There is some leniency for conversations with people we already interacted with usually as long as the conversations don't wander. 
    6. Seeing someone of the opposite gender we should immediately lower our gaze. If lowering gaze does not help, we should find a way to get past the situation.
