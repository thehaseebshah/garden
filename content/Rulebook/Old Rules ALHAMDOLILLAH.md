### RULES CARVED IN STONE:

1. There are two types of [[Rules]]: Normal [[Rules]] and [[Rules]] Carved in Stone (RCIS). RCIS can never ever be nullified or changed by another rule, or avoided through loopholes. They are supreme and have the highest amount of strictness. This is evident by the fact that even spelling mistakes haven't been corrected in these rules, and the numbers have been kept the same too. This is because RCIS are a Contract for a Big Promise with Our Great Lord ALLAH SWT. If this promise is broken, may we in ALLAH's refuge, His curse be upon me till the day of judgement.
2. These [[Rules]] should be kept safe because they still remain even after the record is lost.
3. No rule can be added and no rule can be modified to forgive past penalties, or convert them.
4. RCIS will have clear wording and meanings will be interpreted based on the real, explicit straightforward meaning. No second or implicit meanings will be derived.
5. Optipns can not be added to Penalties. Penalties can't be replaced.
6. Past penalties can not be changed.
- 7. ***Day Streaks [[Rules]]:***
    1. These are valid till Nikah. These can never be paused.
    2. No content is to be watched, looked at (except for first look which can't exceed 2 seconds), or listened to that is considered immodest in Islam.
    3. We can't touch a non mahram for desire.
    4. We can't meet a non mahram in an isolation where we would be able to sin.
    5. Typing, writing or saying words to incite desire in yourself is not allowed, except for forgetfulness.
    6. In case of breaking any of these rules, 1 P3 will be caused. When this is done after exactly 15 mins of breaking the rule, another penalty is caused. This time can only be decreased, not increased.
    7. Looking at a picture/video/photograph of a non mahram or listening to their voice or looking at an intimate conversation for lustful desire is to be considered an immodest act in Islam.
    8. Looking at a picture/video/photograph of an opposite gender or listening to their voice or looking at an intimate conversation for lustful desire is to be considered an immodest act in Islam.
1. 1 P3 can not be changed unless the amount of cash penalty is being increased. Also, the time for the penalty to double can be reduced or the time when another penalty is introduced as a consequence of breaking the rule again, can be decreased. Options can not be added for 1 P3.¬†1 P3 can not be replaced. This applies to past and upcoming penalties.
2. The only way the timer of 1 P3 or any other penalty will stop is if and only if we are in a state of unconsciousness due to an accident, disease or sudden stroke. 1 P3 or any other penalty can be lifted in the case of temporary/permanent memory loss, or permanent unconsciousness/coma/death. It will also stop in the case that we are struck by an incident such as being captured, kidnapped, or locked with no way of getting out, or being in a place or situation where you have no money left and there is no possible way to get cash from somewhere.
3. No other aspects of 1 P3 except the ones mentioned above can be changed.
4. If the Day Streaks Rule is broken unknowingly and we notice that later on, the moment we notice that, 1 P3 is caused.
5. There are some conditions that Shariah has ordained upon which a promise may be broken. Those conditions do not apply to this promise of following the rules to our Lord. If we use one of those conditions to render our promise as broken, the promise will not break ‚Äî what will happen instead of  that 1 P3 will be caused the moment when it is tried to break the promise. Therefore it is impossible to break the promise.
6. All penalties and rules end after death
7. Upon a very serious accident that has caused a major injury that will cause us to not complete a specific type of penalty, all those penalties will be paused pr forgiven, based on the seriousness of the accident. 
8. Upon a major accident wherein the ability to note down or track time is hindered, timers will be paused until we recover from the accident.
9. The only things that can be changed about 1 P3 are as follows: the amount of cash penalty can be increased, the time for the penalty to double can be reduced, the time when another penalty is introduced as a consequence of breaking the rule again, can be decreased.This applies to past and upcoming penalties. No other change can be made.
---

1. The following rules will be added to RCIS immediately when number of penalties becomes zero.
    1. If it was perceived that a penalty has been caused and it was caused in reality, we can not cancel the penalty by using the forgetfulness rule. 
    2. If we forget the number of penalties, this can not be an excuse to cancel them, we will use an upwards estimation to count the penalties.
    3. Unforeseen circumstances for all additions of penalties will not stop the addition.
