## General Plan for Health
Keep above plan and:
- **Increase Portion Sizes:** Stop eating "diet" portions (like CD-sized roti); switch to standard homemade sizes (e.g., 80g roti) to prevent metabolism slowdown.  
- **Add Healthy Fats:** Reintroduce moderate amounts of olive oil, desi ghee, and nuts to support your hormones, skin, and brain health.
- **Relax Food Restrictions:** Occasionally enjoy previously limited foods like bananas, mangoes, or _Dal-Chawal_ to ensure nutrient variety and satisfaction.
- **Prioritize Protein:** Include a solid protein source (meat, eggs, yogurt) in every meal to prevent muscle loss, which can happen with long-term fasting.
