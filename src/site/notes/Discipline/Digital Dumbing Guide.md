# Digital Dumbing SOPs
## Current SOPs:
### 🏗️ Environmental & Device Boundaries
- **Fixed Stations:** Laptop does not leave its dedicated place; keep it at the office or a specific home desk.
- **The "Out of Sight" Rule:** Phone stays in a bag, not a pocket; it remains away during work.
- **BnW:** Keep the screen in Black & White (BnW)
- Prefer audio/text over images/videos.
- **Offline First:** Internet is off by default. Treat the phone like an "Eritrean Internet Cafe" with strictly scheduled online windows.
- **Analog Tools:** Use physical cash; use paper notepads for notes; take directions from people, not GPS.
- No LLMs

### 💬 Communication & Social SOPs
- **Synchronous over Asynchronous:** Call instead of texting; tell people you will call them back rather than chatting all day.
- **The "Letter" Mindset:** Treat non-urgent texts like physical mail—to be answered in batches, not immediately.
- **Scheduled Connectivity:** Check messages only during designated "entertainment/answering" times.
- **Outsourcing Tech:** Ask people for internet searches or have someone else order your Uber to avoid opening the app yourself.

### 📈 Workflow & Productivity
- **Analog Planning:** Planning time is offline. Transfer Calendar and Todoist items to paper for the day's use.
- **Batching:** Sync apps only once a day; list and batch personal online tasks to avoid "quick checks" turning into rabbit holes.
- **Timed Access:** Define "Office Timings" vs. "Entertainment Timings." Only access the browser during specific windows.
- **The 2FA Exception:** Use the phone in the office strictly for Two-Factor Authentication (2FA), then put it away.

### 🧘 Mindset & Maintenance
- **Presence:** Stay in the moment; remember that device-free entertainment is always superior.
- **App Sanctions:** Use _italicized_ apps only on a laptop or within strict limits.
- **The Detox Rule:** Don't use the detox timer when you don't have to.
- **Travel Flexibility:** Office work can go mobile when traveling, but maintain the boundaries as much as possible.
- Don't use western LLMs for personal chats

## Future SOPs:
1. Use Phone Call Feature as a Wired Phone that is placed in a room
2. Read physical books and read pdfs on others' phones
3. Have someone call someone for you, save a list of important contacts or memorize them
4. Ask someone to capture videos and WhatsApp or email you
5. Listen to live lectures and live nasheeds and videos on laptop 
6. Ride priority: walk + bus > walk + hitchhike > bicycle >  motorcycle > ride hailing service
7. Refrain from electricity
8. No VLC in Normal Circumstances
